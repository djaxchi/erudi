// Spawn options for the backend child process (#142).
//
// The Windows backend is a console-subsystem PyInstaller exe (backend.spec:
// console=True, kept so Electron can read the stdout JSON lifecycle events).
// Without windowsHide, Windows allocates a console window for it — an empty
// window that flashes on launch and again briefly whenever the backend crashes.
// stdout still flows through the piped stdio, so hiding the window costs nothing
// (a visible console is NOT required to capture stdout).
//
// `detached` is POSIX-only: killBackend tears the whole tree down with
// kill(-pid) there, but on Windows it uses `taskkill /F /T`, so detaching is
// unnecessary and only contributes the console window.

// Variables the backend must never inherit. `langsmith` rides into the frozen
// build as a transitive dependency of langchain, and ANY of these is enough to
// turn on cloud tracing: LangChain would then POST the system prompt, the
// knowledge-base excerpts, the user's question and the model's answer to
// api.smith.langchain.com, with nothing in the UI to say so. Someone who
// exported LANGCHAIN_TRACING_V2 years ago for an unrelated project must not
// have their conversations exfiltrated by us. The backend also forces the two
// tracing flags off itself (backend/run.py); stripping the whole family here is
// the second lock, and it covers names we have not thought of.

/**
 * Build the environment for the backend child process.
 *
 * Starts from the parent environment — the backend legitimately needs PATH,
 * HOME, HF_TOKEN and the rest — then removes what must not cross, and adds the
 * launcher's own variables.
 *
 * PYTHONUTF8=1 only affects the NON-frozen (dev) interpreter: PyInstaller's
 * bootloader pre-initializes CPython and ignores it, so the packaged build gets
 * UTF-8 mode from the spec's interpreter OPTIONS instead (backend/backend.spec,
 * #168). It is still set here because in dev it makes open() read bundled data
 * files (e.g. alembic.ini) as UTF-8 whatever the locale — a macOS app launched
 * from Finder inherits no LANG (#149).
 *
 * ERUDI_WATCH_STDIN=1 opts the launcher into watching stdin for EOF: on quit we
 * close stdin so the backend shuts down gracefully (stop_postgres), which
 * Windows otherwise never got because taskkill /F /T skips the lifespan (#216).
 *
 * @param {object} parentEnv - typically process.env; never mutated
 * @returns {object} the environment to hand to spawn
