# Erudi Backend — Requirements

Dependencies are split per platform/hardware to keep each build minimal and
reproducible. Composition is layered: an **entrypoint** pulls in shared **meta**
modules (`-r ...`).

## Layout

```

## Key design notes

- **Inference is llama.cpp / MLX, not torch.** torch is only pulled (CPU build)
  by sentence-transformers for the e5 KB embeddings. There is **no torch+CUDA**:
  the CUDA build uses **CPU torch** plus a CUDA-compiled `llama-server` binary
  (built by `scripts/dev/backend/build-llamacpp-cuda-*`). The CUDA toolkit version
  lives in the **binary build**, not in pip — which is why there is a single
  `cuda` entrypoint per OS (no 118/121 split anymore).
- **transformers is pinned once in `base.txt` (5.14.1)** for every platform. The
  floor comes from mlx-vlm 0.6.17 (`transformers>=5.14.0`); it is coupled to
  torch (imports `torch.float8_e8m0fnu`, needing torch>=2.7).
- Fine-tuning deps (peft/accelerate/datasets/bitsandbytes) were removed — the
  feature is unimplemented dead code (see the fine-tuning cleanup issue).

## Usage

```bash
# Dev (with testing/linting tools)
pip install -r requirements/entrypoints/dev/<platform>.txt
# Prod (minimal)
pip install -r requirements/entrypoints/prod/<platform>-prod.txt
```

Or use the platform setup scripts in `scripts/dev/backend/` (they default to prod
in CI; set `INSTALL_TYPE=dev|prod` to force).

## Adding a dependency

- Shared (all platforms) → `meta/base.txt`
- Dev tool → `meta/dev.txt`
- Platform / hardware-specific → the matching `meta/*-specs.txt`

## Changing a version

Every version here is an exact pin, so bumping one can make the whole set
unsolvable — a library's new release may tighten a range around a sibling that
nobody thought to touch.

**Installing into your existing venv does not prove the set resolves.** pip
patches what is already there: it will quietly upgrade a transitive dependency
to satisfy the package you asked for, leave the pin file describing a state no
environment ever ran, and report success. CI builds a venv from nothing and
resolves properly, so it fails where you did not.

Check a bump the way CI will, in a throwaway environment:

```bash
python3.12 -m venv /tmp/resolvenv
/tmp/resolvenv/bin/python -m pip install --dry-run \
    -r requirements/entrypoints/dev/<platform>.txt
```

`--dry-run` resolves and prints what it *would* install without building
anything, so it costs metadata rather than gigabytes. Read the resulting
versions: any package that comes out at something other than its pin is a pin
that needs updating in the same commit.
