"""P2 / Wave C — engine generation guard + idle-cleanup serialization.

The agent layer wraps model resolution + the whole token stream in
``generation_guard``. Idle cleanup (``_cleanup_tick``, looped every 300s by
``_cleanup_monitor``) shares the SAME asyncio lock as the guard, so:

  - the monitor can never reap a model mid-generation (it waits on the lock),
    which is the structural form of review BLOCKER B1;
  - the old reentrant ``threading.Lock`` deadlock (monitor held ``cls._lock``
    then called ``cleanup()`` which re-acquired it) is impossible — there is no
    ``threading.Lock`` left to re-enter.
